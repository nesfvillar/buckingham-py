Buckingham Pi Theorem algorithm for dimensional analysis of systems.

* Caution
There is no guarantee that the program will produce the same adimensional groups every time it runs.
If you plan on using the output, for example for preprocessing values for a neural network, consider saving the transformer, maybe with =pickle=.

#+begin_src python
  import pickle

  with open('transformer-file', 'wb') as f:
      pickle.dump(transformer, f)
#+end_src

Then instead of creating another transformer, which could have different adimensional parameters, just load the saved instance and it will have the original parameters used for the model.

#+begin_src python
  with open('transformer-file', 'rb') as f:
      transformer = pickle.load(f)
#+end_src
